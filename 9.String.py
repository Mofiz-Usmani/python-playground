print(s.isspace())  #Output True


s = " \t  "

# Empty string has no characters, so it’s not considered whitespace







# istitle() checks whether a string is in title case.
# A string is considered title case if each word starts with an uppercase letter and the remaining letters are lowercase.

s = "Hello World"

# isupper() checks whether all alphabetic characters in a string are uppercase.

# swapcase() converts all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase-
# letters to lowercase in a string.

# The title() method converts a string to title case:
# The first letter of each word becomes uppercase
# All other letters become lowercase


s = "pyTHon proGRAMMing"

# =====================
# DocStrings and PEP-8
# =====================

# A docstring is a description written inside triple quotes """ """ at the-
# start of a function or class to explain what it does.

# Written inside triple quotes.
# Must be at the top inside the function/class.
# Used for documentation.




# def add(a, b):
#     """This function adds two numbers and returns the result."""
#     return a + b

# help(add)   # Output: add(a, b)
#     # This function adds two numbers and returns the result.

# print(add(4,6))

# PEP-8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)

# PEP 8 is a set of rules that tell you how to write clean, readable, and professional Python code.
# Think of it like grammar rules for Python coding.


# 🔥 What PEP 8 includes?

# It gives rules for things like:

# ✔ Naming

# variables_like_this

# functions_like_this()

# ClassesLikeThis

# ✔ Indentation

# Use 4 spaces for each indent.

# ✔ Line length

# Keep lines ≤ 79 characters.

# ✔ Spaces

# Add spaces around operators:

# a = 5 + 3

# ✔ Comments

# Use meaningful comments.

# Use docstrings for functions.

# ✔ Blank lines

# Add blank lines between functions to improve readability.

# 👍 Why is PEP 8 important?

# Because it:

# Makes your code clean

# Easy for others to read

# Looks professional

# Followed by almost all Python developers






# The Zen of Python

# The Zen of Python is a collection of guiding principles for writing Python code.
# It’s like Python’s philosophy on how code should look and behave—simple, readable, and elegant.

# On cmd type python then write import this 

# >>> import this
# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
